      <h2>The treatment experience</h2>
      <div class="process">
        <h3>A Deep-Down Cleansing</h3>
        <p>When you sit down for your European facial, you will most likely be in a reclined position, and your hair
          will be secured with a cap to prevent any chemicals from damaging the hair. Once you are made comfortable, the
          skin care specialist will cleanse your skin with an exfoliating scrub to slough off dead skin cells and expose
          healthy skin beneath. This part of the European facial treatment will also remove excess oil, dead skin, and
          even old makeup that may be clogging your pores.</p><br />
        <p>The exfoliating step of the European facial technique will also encourage the skin to renew itself by
          creating new skin cells to repair the micro damage caused by the scrub. Once the exfoliating scrub is
          complete, the skin care specialist will steam your pores open to ensure that all the dirt and other debris has
          been swept away and that skin treatment ingredients can be absorbed to the fullest. Finally, this step of a
          European facial is completed by placing warm towels over the face to enhance the steaming process and the
          expansion of pores for 10-15 Min.</p><br />
      </div>
      <div class="process">
        <h3>Extractions</h3>
        <p>If you suffer from any type of acne, the next step the skin care specialist will take in your European facial
          will be to remove all blackheads and whiteheads from your skin by way of extractions of the problem areas.</p>
        <br />
      </div>
      <div class="process">
        <h3>Massage and Face Mask</h3>
        <p>At this point during your European facial, your esthetician will apply a facial mask that is customized to
          match you specific skin type. Once the mask is applied evenly, it will be left in place for about fifteen
          minutes, during which time the European facial professional will give you a brief massage that will focus on
          the hands, neck. This step is meant to relax your mind and bring the therapeutic effects of the facial
          treatment together with the calming effects of the massage for a more unified rejuvenation experience. Once
          the mask is removed, the skin care specialist will conclude the European facial with a moisturizer and toner
          to prevent the skin from drying out, as a deep cleansing may often cause dryness. Minna only uses the finest
          quality, all natural skin care products on the market from Serene and Repechage.</p>

            After a European facial, you can generally expect an immediate improvement in skin hydration and a radiant,
            healthy glow. You might also experience a slight redness or sensitivity, especially if extractions were
            performed, but this should subside quickly. The skin will feel softer and smoother, and pores may appear
            minimized due to deep cleansing and exfoliation.

            Before a European facial, avoid harsh skincare products, especially exfoliants, and refrain from waxing or
            shaving facial hair for a few days to prevent irritation. After the facial, protect your skin from sun
            exposure, avoid touching your face, and don't apply makeup or other harsh products for a specified period,
            typically 6-12 hours or longer. Staying hydrated and moisturizing are also key to maintaining the benefits.

            <p>
              Unclog and shrink the size of pores: Facials are designed to clean your pores on a much deeper level than
              a typical daily rinse. Overtime, pores fill and widen with the buildup of dirt, oil and debris. Cleaning
              your pores helps to clear your skin and prevent acne on the face, which can thus change the size of your
              pores. Please keep in mind to not pick your skin, as it needs to be cleaned and handled by a professional.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Slow the aging process: Since facials keep your skin feeling healthier, rejuvenated, glowing, and
              smoother, you will feel younger as a result. Not only will you feel younger, but you will also look like
              it, as facials reduce age spots, hydrate the skin, reduce wrinkles, and promote collagen production.
              Collagen production is essential to the skin as it prevents premature aging, wrinkles, and sagging. By
              taking part in the facial process, facials help to reverse aging as nutrients and antioxidants enter the
              skin.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Even the skin tone: An increase in skin cell turnover is also responsible for evening the skin tone. As
              new skin cells reach the surface of your face, it makes your skin smoother and removes scars, blemishes,
              dark spots and more, which makes your skin softer and more even. Please note that dark spots largely come
              from the Sun’s UV rays, so even if you receive a facial, you should always make sure to wear sunscreen
              when exposed to the Sun; people of any age can receive dark spots.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Relieve face tension: Facials are good for your skin but they can also alleviate any pain in your muscles.
              The physical act of receiving a facial massage can actually help to reduce tension in your face and neck
              muscles. If you have been feeling stressed, a facial will ease your muscles and make you feel at peace.

            <p>European facial treatments are generally safe, but some risks can occur, including allergic reactions,

              preparation and aftercare are crucial to minimize these risks. Avoid exfoliating products and waxing
              before the facial, and protect your skin from the sun afterward. </p>
