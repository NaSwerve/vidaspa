      <h2>The treatment experience</h2>
      <div class="process">
        <h3>A Deep-Down Cleansing</h3>
        <p> In a European facial, you will most likely be in a reclined position. Once you are comfortable, the skin
          care specialist will cleanse your skin and gently exfoliate, removing dead skin cells to reveal the healthy
          skin beneath. This part of the European facial treatment will also remove excess oil, dead skin, and even old
          makeup that may be clogging your pores.</p><br />
        <p>The exfoliation step in a European facial plays a key role in promoting skin renewal by removing dead skin
          cells and encouraging the production of new ones. After the exfoliating scrub, a warm towel is applied — not
          only for relaxation, but also to begin preparing the skin for the next steps. Following this, the skincare
          specialist uses steam to open the pores, helping to clear out any dirt and debris and allowing treatment
          products to be better absorbed. To complete this step, a blackhead removal gel is applied for 10–15 minutes to
          enhance the effects of the steam, further soften the pores, and make extractions easier and more effective.
        </p><br />
      </div>
      <div class="process">
        <h3>Extractions</h3>
        <p>For clients dealing with acne, congestion, or clogged pores, the next step in the European facial is deep
          extraction. During this process, the skincare specialist carefully removes blackheads, whiteheads, and other
          impurities from the skin, focusing on the problem areas to help clear out buildup and prevent future
          breakouts.</p>
        <br />
        <p>After the extraction, a <span>high-frequency treatment</span> is applied to the skin. This step helps to
          <span>kill acne-causing
            bacteria</span>, <span>reduce inflammation</span>, and <span>accelerate healing</span>. It also minimizes
          redness and helps tighten the pores,
          leaving the skin calmer, cleaner, and more balanced.</p><br/>
      </div>
      <div class="process">
        <h3>Face Mask</h3>
        <p>At this stage of your European facial, your esthetician will apply a facial mask tailored to your specific
          skin type and needs. Once evenly applied, the mask will remain on the skin for approximately 15 minutes. This
          step is designed to not only nourish and treat the skin, but also to relax your mind and enhance the overall
          therapeutic experience, complemented by calming music for full-body rejuvenation.</p><br />
        <p>After the mask is gently removed, your esthetician will complete the treatment with the application of a
          customized <span>serum</span>, <span>moisturizer</span>, and your choice of <span>tinted or regular
            sunscreen</span>. At Vida Spa, we are proud to
          use only high-quality professional skincare products sourced from top brands in the <span>USA</span>,
          <span>Korea</span>, and <span>Germany</span>.

            <h4>Before & After Care for a European Facial</h4>
            <p>To get the best results from your European facial, it’s important to follow a few simple guidelines:</p>
            <br />
            <p><span>Before your facial</span>, avoid using harsh skincare products, especially exfoliants, and refrain
              from waxing or shaving facial hair for at least a few days to prevent irritation.</p><br />
            <p><span>After your facial</span>, protect your skin by avoiding direct sun exposure and refraining from
              using any harsh
              products for at least 6 to 12 hours, or longer if advised. Try to avoid touching your face, and stay
              well-hydrated. Applying a gentle <span>moisturizer</span> regularly will help maintain your glow.</p>
            <br />
            <p>If you are using any medications, especially blood thinners, prescribed retinoids, or Accutane, please
              inform our skincare professionals before your treatment. Also, be sure to use <span>sunscreen
                daily</span>, and <span>reapply
                every 2 to 3 hours</span> to keep your skin protected.</p><br />

            <p>
              Unclog and shrink the size of pores: Facials are designed to clean your pores on a much deeper level than
              a typical daily rinse. Overtime, pores fill and widen with the buildup of dirt, oil and debris. Cleaning
              your pores helps to clear your skin and prevent acne on the face, which can thus change the size of your
              pores. Please keep in mind to not pick your skin, as it needs to be cleaned and handled by a professional.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Slow the aging process: Since facials keep your skin feeling healthier, rejuvenated, glowing, and
              smoother, you will feel younger as a result. Not only will you feel younger, but you will also look like
              it, as facials reduce age spots, hydrate the skin, reduce wrinkles, and promote collagen production.
              Collagen production is essential to the skin as it prevents premature aging, wrinkles, and sagging. By
              taking part in the facial process, facials help to reverse aging as nutrients and antioxidants enter the
              skin.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Even the skin tone: An increase in skin cell turnover is also responsible for evening the skin tone. As
              new skin cells reach the surface of your face, it makes your skin smoother and removes scars, blemishes,
              dark spots and more, which makes your skin softer and more even. Please note that dark spots largely come
              from the Sun’s UV rays, so even if you receive a facial, you should always make sure to wear sunscreen
              when exposed to the Sun; people of any age can receive dark spots.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Relieve face tension: Facials are good for your skin but they can also alleviate any pain in your muscles.
              The physical act of receiving a facial massage can actually help to reduce tension in your face and neck
              muscles. If you have been feeling stressed, a facial will ease your muscles and make you feel at peace.

            <p>European facial treatments are generally safe, but some risks can occur, including allergic reactions,

              preparation and aftercare are crucial to minimize these risks. Avoid exfoliating products and waxing
              before the facial, and protect your skin from the sun afterward. </p>
