            skin. Sunscreen with SPF 30 or above should be used daily. If you
            are under the sun for prolonged periods of time, sunscreen needs
            to be reapplied at least once every two hours.

            Ultraformer MPT is the newest upgraded generation of Ultraformer
            device, using highly sophisticated Micro and Macro Ultrasound
            energy to rejuvenate three critical levels of your skin’s
            infrastructure.The new Ultraformer MPT now includes the Deep
            Synergy Booster, delivers deep hydration, anti-ageing and skin
            healing propertiesto the skin cells.

              High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) transducers deliver
              concentrated waves of ultrasound into multiple layers of skin
              and body tissues without making direct contact with surrounding
              areas or damaging the surface. Transferring stabilized
              temperatures of 65-75°C into the targeted zones, the Ultraformer
              induces a process of neocollagenesis.

            <p>Ultraformer does not affect the outer layers of the skin, so there are minimal side effects or risks.
              However, due to the different levels of Ultraformer treatment available, side effects may vary. You may
              experience some mild swelling, tenderness or redness after your Ultraformer procedure, which will subside
              within 48 hours. Rest assured our registered nurses will advise what you can expect in your pre-treatment
              consultation.</p><br />

            <p>Ultraformer has three differing levels, which target to three different depths of the skin. After an

            <p>The main difference between this and the Ultraformer III is the huge reduction in discomfort with the
              newer model. You might feel a gentle warming sensation as the energy works to stimulate collagen
              production and tighten existing collagen fibers. The procedure is generally well-tolerated, with many
              individuals experiencing minimal discomfort. The Ultraformer MPT provides a more comfortable painless
              experience through its innovative Micro Pulsed Technology, tailored to suit various skin types. Those who
              have undergone different HIFU procedures using alternative devices have noted considerably reduced
              discomfort in treated regions on both the body and face when compared to previous experiences. </p>
