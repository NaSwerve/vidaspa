    <div class="experience-content">
      <h2>The treatment experience</h2>
      <p>
        A conductor gel is applied to the targeted area, ensuring smooth contact. The Ultraformer MPT handpiece is then
        placed on your skin, emitting precise micro-focused ultrasound energy where you might feel a gentle warming or
        tingling sensation. Our Aesthetician will start at the deepest skin layer, repeat the process again using
        different probes to target every skin layer and depth to ensure the best possible results. Your face will begin
        to feel tighter right after the appointment.

            After your treatment, you may experience some redness, swelling, or tenderness in the treated area, which
            typically resolves within a few hours to a few days. You may also notice an immediate tightening effect,
            with continued improvement over the following weeks as collagen production increases. Your skin will produce
            Collagen for up to 4 months.

            There are no special requirements for Ultraformer. We recommend taking vitamin C to help the metabolism
            synthesize collagen. You can apply makeup, exercise, and bathe as usual after your treatment. We always
            recommend using sunscreen to prevent sun damage to the skin. Sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher should be
            used daily. If you are exposed to the sun for prolonged periods, sunscreen needs to be reapplied at least
            every two hours.

              Ultraformer MPT is the newest upgraded generation of the Ultraformer device, using highly sophisticated
              Micro and Macro Ultrasound energy to rejuvenate three critical levels of your skin’s infrastructure.
              High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) transducers deliver concentrated waves of ultrasound into
              multiple layers of skin and body tissues without making direct contact with surrounding areas or damaging
              the surface. Transferring stabilized temperatures of 65-75°C into the targeted zones, the Ultraformer
              induces a process of neocollagenesis.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We use the Ultraformer MTP Technology, the world’s number one choice for non-invasive skin lifting &
              tightening treatments. It is the most advanced focused-ultrasound device with seven calibrated cartridge
              depths to elicit multi-layer contraction for facial contouring, wrinkle reduction, and overall skin laxity
              improvement.

              However, due to the different levels of Ultraformer treatment available, side effects may vary. You may
              experience some mild swelling, tenderness or redness after your Ultraformer procedure, which will subside
              within 48 hours.</p><br />
