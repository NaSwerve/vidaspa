  <!-- Treatment Description -->
  <section class="treatment-description">
    <p>
      Laser hair removal is a cosmetic procedure that uses concentrated light (lasers) to target and destroy hair
      follicles, reducing or eliminating hair growth. It's a popular method for long-term hair reduction, though not
      always a permanent solution, as some hair may eventually regrow.

      <h2>The treatment experience</h2>
      <p>
        Laser hair removal at VidaSpaNYC typically involves a consultation, the actual treatment, and post-care. During
        the consultation, the technician assesses your skin type and hair, and discusses the procedure. The treatment
        involves using a handheld device to deliver laser pulses, potentially causing a slight tingling sensation as it
        targets hair follicles.

  <!-- Benefits -->
  <section class="benefits">
    <h2>Benefits:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Permanent hair reduction: Laser hair removal can significantly reduce hair growth over time. While it's not
        always perfectly permanent, many people experience a long-lasting reduction in hair, with some even achieving
        permanent hair removal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Precision: Lasers can target specific hair follicles without damaging the surrounding skin, making it a precise
        method for hair removal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduced Ingrown Hairs: By damaging or destroying hair follicles, laser hair removal can prevent future ingrown
        hairs, which are a common problem with other methods like shaving or waxing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cost-Effectiveness (Long-Term): While the initial cost of laser hair removal can be higher than other methods,
        the long-term savings from not needing to purchase razors, shaving cream, or waxing appointments can make it a
        more cost-effective option in the long run.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved Skin Texture: Laser hair removal can lead to smoother, clearer skin in the treated areas as it
        eliminates ingrown hairs and reduces the need for frequent shaving or waxing.
      </li>
    </ul>

            After laser hair removal, expect some redness and slight swelling, similar to a mild sunburn, which should
            subside within a few hours to a day. You'll likely notice hair shedding within 1-3 weeks as targeted hairs
            exit the follicles.

              Laser hair removal uses concentrated light beams to target melanin (the pigment in hair).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The light energy is converted to heat, damaging the hair follicle and inhibiting future growth.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This process is most effective when hair is in its active growth phase (anagen), which is why multiple
              treatments are needed to target follicles at different growth stages.

              Laser hair removal significantly reduces hair growth and can make hair finer and lighter, but it's not
              always a permanent solution.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Hormonal fluctuations can affect hair regrowth, and some individuals may experience some hair regrowth
              over time.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Results vary per person, and some may achieve 100% hair reduction while others may see some fine hairs
              grow back.
