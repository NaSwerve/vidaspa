      <p>
        The treatment area is cleansed, and topical anesthetic may be applied to minimize discomfort. The dermatologist
        uses a handheld Pico laser device to deliver ultra-short energy pulses to the targeted areas. The treated area
        is cleaned, and a soothing ointment is applied. Sun protection is crucial, and the VidaSpaNYC will provide
        aftercare
        instructions.

      <li>
        Reduces pigmentation and dark spots - Laser treatments can effectively target and diminish the appearance of

        Improves skin tone and texture - Laser treatments can address redness, vascular concerns, and uneven skin
        texture, resulting in a more uniform and refined complexion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduces acne scars - Laser toning can help improve the appearance of acne scars by encouraging the growth of
        new, healthy skin cells.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provides long-lasting results - While the number of sessions needed varies, laser skin brightening treatments

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I had one treatment with the pico laser which took around 1 hour and was virtually pain-free. The colour of the
        pigmentation has reduced by about 60%, the treatment was very quick and easy. I am looking forward to my second
        treatment which I am confident will remove the rest of the pigmentation."

            After your treatment, you can expect some redness, swelling, and a sunburn-like sensation in the treated
            area, which are normal reactions as the skin heals. The skin may also feel warm or sensitive. These effects
            are usually temporary, with redness and swelling subsiding within a few days. As the skin heals, it may also
            peel or flake, and some darkening of pigmentation spots can occur initially before they fade.

            <p>Before a laser skin brightening treatment avoid sun exposure, tanning beds, and self-tanners for several
              weeks beforehand. You should also stop
              using certain skincare products like retinol and hydroquinone a few days before the procedure.
              Additionally, it's important to discontinue the use of blood-thinning medications and supplements, and to
              avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.</p><br />
            <p>
              After laser skin brightening treatment, it's crucial to protect your skin from sun exposure, avoid harsh
              skincare products, and refrain from
              activities that can irritate the treated area. Specifically, you should avoid direct sunlight for several
              weeks, use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with high SPF, and skip products containing retinol, glycolic acid,
              or alcohol. Also, avoid touching or picking at the treated area and refrain from heavy workouts or hot
              environments that could cause sweating or irritation.

              Laser skin brightening treatment works by using focused light energy to target and break down excess
              melanin, the pigment responsible for dark spots and uneven skin tone. The laser selectively heats and
              fragments the melanin, allowing the body to naturally remove it, leading to a brighter and more even
              complexion. Additionally, the treatment can stimulate collagen production, which contributes to overall
              skin
              rejuvenation and a youthful appearance.
