  <section class="treatment-description">
    <p>
      Fibroblast treatment, is a non-surgical cosmetic procedure that uses a pen-like device to deliver targeted
      electrical currents to the skin. This process creates tiny, controlled micro-injuries, stimulating the skin's
      natural healing response and promoting the production of collagen and elastin.

  <!-- Treatment Areas -->
  <section class="treatment-area">
    <h2>Treatment Areas</h2>
    <div class="treatment-item">
      <h3>Eyes</h3>
      <p>They say our eyes are the windows to our soul, so why not have a nice-looking window frame to make the gaze
        more welcoming!</p><br />
      <p>
        The treatment can help target several eye-specific areas: upper and lower eyelid sagging, bags, and fine lines –
        including crow’s feet. But don’t think services are limited to tightening and reducing wrinkles; you can also
        get an eye or eyelid lift. Hello, cat eye!
      </p><br />
    </div>
    <div class="treatment-item">
      <h3>Forehead</h3>
      <p>Raise your hand if you enjoy having forehead wrinkles? </p><br />
      <p>
        *Crickets*
      </p><br />
      <p>Yeah … neither do we! </p><br />
      <p>Don’t worry – we’ve got you covered. Whether it’s a case of the 11’s – the lines between your eyes – or
        wrinkles, this treatment is a perfect solution to those deep, expressive lines. </p><br />
    </div>
    <div class="treatment-item">
      <h3>Neck </h3>
      <p>Tightening the neck can help treat “turkey neck” or “jowls” and keep wrinkles and other fine lines at bay. Who
        knows, you might see that jaw line reemerge!</p><br />
    </div>
    <div class="treatment-item">
      <h3>Chest </h3>
      <p>Who doesn’t love a lift without going under the knife! Our alternative to a breast lift, the fibroblast
        treatment is the perfect way to tighten skin due to weight fluctuations, chest feeding, and our nemesis,
        gravity. Other common chest issues like premature aging and sunspots can be tackled with a decolletage treatment
        in addition or as a standalone treatment. </p><br />
    </div>
    <div class="treatment-item">
      <h3>Lips</h3>
      <p>Our lips are constantly in motion, so it’s no surprise that they can show signs of aging faster than anywhere
        else on our body. </p><br />
      <p>
        From frown lines, smokers lines, nasolabial folds to a lip flip – the procedure can help you reduce,tighten, and
        address asymmetry inthese key areas.
      </p><br />
    </div>
    <div class="treatment-item">
      <h3>Core limbs</h3>
      <p>Stomach, arms, knees, hands, elbows – oh my! </p><br />
      <p>
        When we said nothing is off-limits, we meant it. Tightening treatments are perfect for the belly, arms, and
        knees, where skin tends to sag with age (or life milestones, like having a baby).

  <!-- Benefits -->
  <section class="benefits">
    <h2>Benefits:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reduces wrinkles and fine lines: By stimulating collagen and elastin, fibroblast treatment can significantly
        soften and diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines, especially around the eyes, forehead, and lips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tightens loose skin: It can help lift and tighten sagging skin on the face, neck, and other body areas,
        improving overall skin firmness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Treats heavy eyelids and under-eye bags: Plasma fibroblast is a safe and effective treatment for lifting droopy
        eyelids and reducing the appearance of under-eye bags.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improves skin texture and tone: The treatment can smooth out uneven skin texture and improve overall skin tone,
        resulting in a more youthful and radiant appearance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Minimally invasive and minimal downtime: Compared to surgical procedures, fibroblast treatment is minimally
        invasive, with relatively short recovery periods and minimal side effects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Long-lasting results: While the longevity of results can vary, fibroblast treatment can provide long-lasting
        improvements in skin appearance due to its collagen-stimulating effects, according to b. sweet pflugerville.

            After fibroblast treatment, you can expect some redness, swelling, and tiny crusts or scabs on the treated
            area. These are normal side effects that usually resolve within a few days to a couple of weeks. The treated
            skin may also feel like a mild sunburn and appear dry or flaky as it heals. You'll also likely see immediate
            skin tightening and lifting, with continued improvements over the following weeks and months.

              Post treatment Do not pick scabs! Removing the scabs prematurely may result in scarring and discoloration.
              Allow scabs to come off on their own. This will ensure the best possible result and avoid scarring,
              hyperpigmentation and infection. If you feel the scabs are accidentally being rubbed off prematurely, then
              protect them with by covering them with Aquaphor to prevent falling off too early. The longer the scabs
              stay
              put the longer the skin has a chance to heal itself with the protection of the scab.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              Ice the treated area using a clean towel to cover the ice pack each use. Alternate 10 minutes on and off
              for up to 1 hour for the first 2 days.
            </p><br />
            <p>
              Do not apply makeup (even mineral makeup) until the scabbing has fallen off completely. This is to avoid
              infection or disrupting the scabs prematurely.

            The Plasma Fibroblast Skin Tightening treatment involves using a hand-held, electronic medical device that
            generates a plasma charge, or arc, from the ions in the air between the tip of the device and the surface of
            the skin. The energy is then transferred into the skin and activates the fibroblasts in the dermis to
            repair. At the point where the plasma arc touches the skin, a tiny carbon dot is produced due to the thermal
            reaction of the skin, and the skin around this dot contracts. When many small dots are created in an optimal
            grid-like pattern in a targeted area, the whole area contracts resulting in a visible tightening of the
            skin.

            <p>
              Fibroblasts are special cells in the dermis layer of the skin whose main function is to produce
              tropocollagen that fills the spaces between cells and fibres in connective tissue. They appear to play
              an important part in wound healing, as following tissue injury, they migrate to the site of damage where
              they deposit new collagen and facilitate the healing process.
