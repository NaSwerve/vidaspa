            <p>
                Exosomes can be applied to the skin's surface in the form of creams, serums, or masks. The exosomes are
                gently massaged into the skin, allowing them to penetrate and communicate with the cells in the
                epidermis and dermis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microneedling create microchannels on the skin's surface, and the exosomes can be applied topically and
                then infused
                into the skin through these microchannels, enhancing their absorption and effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                For more targeted and intensive rejuvenation, exosomes can be injected directly into specific areas of
                the face. This technique allows for the precise delivery of exosomes to deeper layers of the skin,
                stimulating collagen production and promoting overall skin rejuvenation.

                        After exosome therapy, you can generally expect minimal downtime and a gradual improvement in
                        the treated area. Mild side effects like redness, swelling, or bruising at the injection site
                        are possible but usually subside quickly. The full benefits of the therapy, such as skin
                        rejuvenation or hair regrowth, may take several weeks or months to become noticeable as the
                        exosomes work to stimulate cellular repair and regeneration.

                        Exosome therapy utilizes exosomes, which are tiny vesicles released by cells, to facilitate
                        cell-to-cell communication and promote tissue regeneration. These exosomes act as messengers,
                        carrying proteins and genetic material to target cells, stimulating healing and rejuvenation
                        processes within the body. In essence, exosome therapy harnesses the body's natural healing
                        mechanisms to address various conditions, including skin rejuvenation, joint issues, and even
                        potential benefits in neurodegenerative diseases.
